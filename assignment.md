# Challenge: CI/CD with GitHub Actions

- **Repository:** `challenge-ci-cd-github`
- **Type of Challenge:** Consolidation
- **Duration:** 2 days
- **Deadline:** 20/06/2025 - 5:00 PM
- **Team Challenge:** Solo

## 🎯 Mission Objectives

Practice **CI/CD with GitHub Actions** by simulating **Dev → QA → Prod environments** within free account limits.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- Understand GitHub Actions workflows.
- Run automated build & test jobs (CI).
- Simulate deployments to multiple environments (CD).
- Use GitHub Environments & approvals.
- Work with branches and branch protections.

## 📝 The Mission

You apply for a junior DevOps position.  
As part of the technical test, you must set up a **GitHub Actions pipeline** that:

- Builds & tests the code (CI).
- Deploys to **Dev, QA, and Prod** environments (CD).
- Requires **approval** before going live in production.

## ✅ Must-Have Features

- CI workflow runs tests on **pull requests → main**.
- CD workflow deploys automatically:
  - To **Dev** on push to `dev` branch.
  - To **QA** on push to `qa` branch.
  - To **Prod** on push to `main` branch (**with approval**).
- Each deploy step outputs a log like:  
   🚀 Deployed to 'environment'

## 🌟 Nice-to-Have Features

- Add linting before build.
- Upload artifacts (e.g., test reports, build output).
- Deploy a sample app (streamlit).
- Use secrets to simulate credentials.

## ⚙️ Constraints

- Use **Streamlit** for the sample app.
- The app should display a different message or style depending on the environment:
  - **Dev** → page title “Dev Environment” + green background.
  - **QA** → page title “QA Environment” + yellow background.
  - **Prod** → page title “Production Environment” + red background.
- Keep **CI** and **CD** in separate workflow files:
  - `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/cd.yml`
- Use GitHub **Environments** with approvals required for Prod.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `README.md` → Project documentation (description, usage, screenshots)
- `app/` → Sample application code
  - `main.py` → Example entry point (Python/Node.js/etc.)
- `tests/` → Unit tests for CI
  - `test_app.py`
- `.github/workflows/` → GitHub Actions workflows
  - `ci.yml` → Continuous Integration (tests on PRs)
  - `cd.yml` → Continuous Delivery (deploy to Dev/QA/Prod)

## 📦 Deliverables

- Public GitHub repo with workflows enabled.
- README must include:
  - Description
  - How to trigger CI/CD
  - Example logs or screenshots
